# CapsuleStream520
CS520 Final Project

CapsuleStream is a social media app with functionality for user to sign-up/login with proper authentification, generate/update/delete posts, interact with posts (comment/like), search for posts based on tags, see posts by users, see the most popular posts for the previous week, update user settings (receive email notifications and update username/password), and receive notifications of new posts to a provided email. The user is able to interact with other users and navigate through the site using an intuitive navbar. The contained environment leverages the MERN stack to create a front end react implementation for UI, express for interactions between the server and the UI, MongoDB to store relevant user and post schemas, and finally node to operate the server side portion.
