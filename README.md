# CapsuleStream520
## CS520 Final Project

**CapsuleStream** is a social media application that allows users to:

- Sign up, log in, and authenticate securely
- Generate, update, and delete posts
- Interact with posts by commenting and liking
- Search for posts based on tags
- View posts from specific users
- See the most popular posts from the previous week
- Update user settings (email notifications, username/password)
- Receive email notifications for new posts
- Interact with other users and navigate through the app with an intuitive navbar

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React (UI)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (server-side interactions)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user and post data)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Email Notifications**: Nodemailer for sending email notifications
- **Search**: Full-text search using MongoDB's built-in features

This app uses the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to create a full-stack social media experience.
